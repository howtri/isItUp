Package that builds a site that accepts a domain name or IP from the landing page and checks if the site is available
via tcp socket connection. Stores sites checked and their statuses in a local sqlite db. Routes are exposed with Flask
via gunicorn. Nginx is used as the reverse-proxy to accept requests.

All necessary files to run the application are contained within application/app. The ansible-playbook directory is
only needed for the controller to configure hosts to run the application.
If you are using ansible from your machine you must install Ansible
ex: sudo apt-get install ansible
Then you must modify the IPs within ansible-playbook/deploy/hosts
Run playbook with: ansible-playbook deploy.yaml
